Carl: Hello
Charley, it's nice to meet you. I'd be happy to help you with your quest. Where do you need me to go to find some jokes?

Charley Murphy: Thank you Carl, I appreciate your help. I need you to go to the top of the mountain and find a wise old owl who is known for his clever wit. He should be able to give you a joke or two.
