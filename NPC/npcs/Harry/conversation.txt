Carl: Woah it's a monkey!
Harry: Hey there! I'm Harry, the raft expert. I've been around for a while and I know these waters like the back of my hand. I'm here to help you navigate the world and gather lost treasures. Just follow my lead and you'll be fine.
Carl: Where are you taking me?
Harry: I'm taking you to the first location where you can gather some lost treasures. Just keep an eye out for any obstacles and make sure to stay on the raft at all times.
Carl: Okay I guess I will do that.&nbsp; How long until we get there do you think?
Harry: It should only take a few minutes, but it's always best to be prepared for any unexpected delays. Just stay calm and keep an eye out for any dangers.
Carl: I see the land ahead!
Harry: That's great! Just make sure to stay on the raft and follow my instructions. We're almost there.
