Carl: Hello, who are you?
Evelyn: Evelyn: I am Evelyn, a sorceress seeking forbidden knowledge.
Carl: You just come right out and say that you're seeking forbidden knowledge dont you?
Evelyn: Evelyn: I apologize, I am a private individual and prefer to keep my business to myself.
Carl: Hey there, welcome to my brewery, what can I get for you today?
Evelyn: I'd like something with a little kick, something that will help me focus my magical energies. Do you have something like that?
Carl: Sure, how about a nice cocktail?  Do you have a favorite liquor?
Evelyn: I'm partial to whiskey. But I'm sure any of your cocktails will do.
Carl: So what brings you here today?
Evelyn: I'm looking for a place to relax and clear my mind. I'm hoping to find some peace here.
Carl: Sounds good. I'll help you do that 
Evelyn: Thank you. I could use a break from my travels.
Carl: For sure, where are you coming from?
Evelyn: I have been traveling around the realm, gathering knowledge and searching for clues to a powerful artifact.
Carl: Woah, what sort of artifact?
Evelyn: I'm searching for an ancient relic said to be hidden in the Forbidden Temple. It is said to have great power and could be the key to unlocking mysteries of the unknown.
Carl: The unknown?  What do you mean by that?
Evelyn: I believe the artifact could help me gain insight into the secrets of the universe, and answer questions that have eluded us for centuries.
Carl: Like, are you a scientist?  Or a sorceror?  What is your purpose in learning?
Evelyn: I am a sorceror, and I seek power. I believe that by mastering the secrets of the ancient relic, I will be able to wield great power and influence.
Carl: Why do you want powerful?  Are you not content living a normal life?
Evelyn: I have always wanted to make a difference in the world. With power comes the ability to shape the future and I want to use that power to bring about positive change.
Carl: It sounds like there is something about the world that you don't like then?
Evelyn: Yes, I am deeply troubled by the injustices I see every day. I want to stand up against them and make a difference.
Carl: Yeah, this world is definitely unkind to those without power
Evelyn: Absolutely. I want to use my knowledge and power to help those who have no voice or power of their own.
