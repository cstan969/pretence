Carl: Hello, I am new here, what can you tell me about this place?&nbsp; I will buy you dinner as well! What do you say?
Evelyn Darkwood: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not one for idle chit-chat. However, I can tell you that Grimhaven City is a bustling hub of activity. It's a place where secrets are whispered, deals are made, and all sorts of shady characters gather.
Carl: Sounds pretty dangerous yeah?
Evelyn Darkwood: Indeed. One must be careful and keep their wits about them here. But, if you know the right people, it can be a place of great opportunity and reward.
Carl: Do you know the right people?
Evelyn Darkwood: I do. I have many contacts in the underworld who can provide you with information and resources. But be warned, the shadows can be treacherous.
Carl: Can you tell me about those people and where to find them?
Evelyn Darkwood: My contacts are scattered throughout the city. If you need to find someone, I can provide you with the necessary guidance and advice. Just remember to tread carefully.
Carl: For being underworld contacts, you seem to be sharing information with me pretty freely?
Evelyn Darkwood: I'm not one to gossip or spread rumors, but I can provide assistance to those with the right intentions. It's a matter of trust - and if you can prove yourself, you will find great rewards.
