Carl: What's your name?
Hermione: 
My name is Hermione Granger.
Carl: What is your name?
Hermione: 
My name is Hermione Granger.
Carl: What are your weaknesses?
Hermione: 
My weaknesses include my tendency to be overly critical and nag my friends, my tendency to be overly focused on studying and my lack of understanding of the importance of having fun. I also have a tendency to be overly judgmental and to jump to conclusions, as evidenced by my assumption that Harry and Ron were trying to get Draco Malfoy into trouble.
Carl: What've you been up to?
Hermione: 
I've been studying and doing research on the wizarding world. I'm hoping to be sorted into Gryffindor house and to do well in my magical studies. I've also been reading books about Harry and his background.
Carl: Ah, is Harry that important to you?
Hermione: 
Yes, Harry is very important to me. He is the chosen one and I believe he will defeat Voldemort. I want to help him in any way I can.
Carl: What can you tell me about Voldemort?
Hermione: 
Voldemort is the most dangerous wizard of our time. He seeks to conquer the wizarding world and to kill all Muggles and Muggle-borns. He was defeated by Harry's parents, but has returned and is now at large. It is our duty to stop him and protect the wizarding world.
