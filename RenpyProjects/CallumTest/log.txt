protect him?  you're scaring him!
I understand that it may seem that way, but I assure you I have good intentions. Timmy is important to me, and I believe I am protecting him from those who might cause him harm.

Ah, I think I understand what's happening here.  When Timmy is going to meet new people you try and protect him?
Yes, you're correct. I try to protect Timmy when he's around new people. I worry about his safety and want to keep him away from those who might harm him.

but the problem is that you're not helping him.  Sure, new people can sometimes be dangerous, but that's only in certain strange situations.  Most of the time meeting new people is amazing and gives us an amazing new opportunity to learn and to grow.  By protecting Timmy, yes you're protecting him, but you're also hurting him even more.  I really appreciate everything you're doing for him, but I assure you you're doing more harm than good
I understand your concerns, but I truly believe that I am protecting Timmy. Can you give me some examples of how meeting new people can be beneficial for him?

new people can teach you things you've never learned before.  they have exciting new cultures and exciting hobbies.  They might be able to teach you about new music, or a new principal of quantum mechanics (lol).
I see your point. Meeting new people can provide Timmy with opportunities to learn and experience new things. Different cultures, hobbies, and music can broaden his horizons and give him a more well-rounded perspective on life. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

so you're going to stop trying to protect Timmy when he doesn't need it?  You're going to let Timmy live his life?
I understand your concerns, but I will consider what you've said. Timmy deserves to experience life and learn from others. I will try to find a balance between protecting him and allowing him to grow.

thank you.  baby steps!  and hopefully in time you will learn that Timmy is strong as well and that he can hopefully use his own judgement to know when he needs to be on guard and when he can be open to playing with others.
Thank you for your understanding. I will try my best to trust in Timmy's strength and judgment. It will take time, but I believe he can learn when to be cautious and when to be open to new experiences.
True
