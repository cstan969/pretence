I... I know of a place... 'The Rusty Mug'... It's nearby, just a few blocks away... Some... Some people say it's a decent place to rest and grab a drink... But... but you should be careful... trouble... trouble seems to find its way there...

i think i heard it was something tum tum or something like that?
Ah, Tum Tum's tavern... It brings back memories of better times. It's not the safest place these days, though. I'm afraid it's fallen on hard times.
