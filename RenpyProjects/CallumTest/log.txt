Dude, Mr Waffle, seriously.  just have a chat with me, I'm homeless. I have no food nor water.  Can you not make me a sandwich or something?  is there not food in abundance here?
Oh, poor little homeless human. Maybe you should have thought about that before you chased after me! I won't be your personal chef, so good luck finding food on your own!
