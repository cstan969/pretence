uhhhh well everything seems super blurry, so there is that...
Oh, I see. Blurriness is quite common after being in cryogenic slumber for a long time. It might take a little while for your vision to fully return. But don't worry, you're in safe hands here. Nurse Nectarine is currently preparing some food for you. In the meantime, let's try to get you acquainted with the world outside. Can you remember anything before you went to sleep? What is the last event you remember?
False
