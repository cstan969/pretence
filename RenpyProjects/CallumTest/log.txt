The setting is a post-apocalyptic realm where darkness and despair have shrouded the land, but amidst the ruins, pockets of hope and resilience emerge.', 'world_npc_prompt': "The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the remnants of civilization struggle to survive amidst the ruins of the past. The landscape is a mix of desolate wastelands, crumbling cities, and overgrown nature. Dilapidated buildings stand as silent witnesses to the world's former glory, their walls marked by time and decay.  Nature has begun to reclaim its dominion, with tangled vegetation covering once bustling streets and the sound of wildlife echoing through abandoned alleyways. Vast stretches of barren lands, scarred by the cataclysmic event that caused society's collapse, stretch out into the distance, evoking a sense of desolation and isolation.  Scattered throughout the world are isolated settlements, where survivors have banded together in the face of adversity. These settlements are often comprised of makeshift structures, cobbled together from salvaged materials, and fortified against the dangers of the wasteland. Life within the settlements is a constant struggle for resources, safety, and the rebuilding of a new society.  Amidst the gloom and harshness, there are glimpses of hope and beauty. A vibrant sunset paints the sky with hues of orange and gold, offering a fleeting respite from the harsh reality. In the depths of the forest, hidden pockets of untouched nature harbor secrets and mystical creatures, providing a stark contrast to the crumbling remnants of human civilization.  It is a world where survival instincts prevail, where the resilience of the human spirit is tested, and where the bonds of community and the pursuit of redemption become beacons of light in the darkness. It is within this challenging and evocative setting that the game's story unfolds, as players navigate the perils and mysteries of a world forever changed."}
