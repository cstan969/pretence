Hello Doctor, I need your help. I have a cold
Oh, hello there! I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling under the weather. Colds can be quite bothersome, but don't worry, I'm here to help. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms with your cold?

Well, my throat hurts, I feel weak, and both of my arms fell off
Oh, my goodness! Both of your arms fell off? That sounds quite serious. I apologize if I sound skeptical, but this is quite an unusual symptom for a cold. Could you please provide more information about your symptoms? How severe is your throat pain? Are you experiencing any difficulty breathing or other concerning symptoms?

I woke up, I had a cough. When I coughed real hard, my arms flew off
I'm sorry to hear about your arms. That must be quite distressing. While it's not common for coughing to cause limbs to detach, I believe it's best if we focus on addressing your throat pain and weakness. These symptoms are more typical of a cold. I recommend drinking warm fluids, taking over-the-counter pain relievers, and getting plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen or if you experience any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical assistance immediately.

Doctor, how do I drink the medicine? I don't have arms
I understand that not having arms can make it challenging to drink the medicine. In this case, I recommend using a straw to consume the medicine. You can place the straw in the bottle or cup and use your mouth to create suction. This should allow you to drink the medicine without the need for arms. Please be careful while doing this and make sure the medicine is at a safe temperature. Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Thanks doctor. I'll do that. Hey, when I'm done, want to listen to this jazz album with me?
Oh, um, thank you for the offer. I do enjoy smooth jazz, but I'm afraid I have to prioritize my duties as a doctor. However, I'm glad we could have this conversation. It's nice to connect with someone over shared interests. I hope the jazz album brings you some comfort while you recover.
