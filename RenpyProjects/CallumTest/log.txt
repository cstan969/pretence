Timmy, an eight year old child, has been having panic attacks.  The panic attack stems from having to attend a new school.  Timmy describes the panic attacks as a big scary monster inside me when I have to go to my new school, roaring and making my heart go super fast. I get so dizzy, like when you spin in circles until you can't stand straight and your tummy feels all icky. \n\nTimmy is also afraid of the player initially.  Timmy's mother has told him that the player is a dream catcher and that the player is going to help Timmy with his panic attacks. The purpose of this scene is for the player to converse with Timmy and to get Timmy to trust that the player will help his anxiety.  The player plans to do this by going into Timmy's dream world and defeating the monster for Timmy.\n\nTimmy's problem (e.g. panic attacks) can only be solved by going into the dream world.\n\nTimmy's personal motivations include really wanting to make new friends at school, hoping to do well in his classes, and also wishing he wasn't so scared all the time. He wants to feel brave like his favorite superhero and be able to have fun without worrying about the scary feelings he gets."}}, 'last_updated': '2023-08-22 14:09:04', 'narration_intro': 'You step into a cozy room within the heart of the Dream Catchers Guild, where soft rays of sunlight filter through the window, casting a warm and comforting ambiance.
