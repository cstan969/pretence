holy crap, a screaming sandwich!
Ah, your surprise is quite understandable, dear sir. However, I assure you, I am as real as the post-apocalyptic world around us. Now, how may I assist you today?

Sir Sandwich
James Thomas Stanhope
not really.  I prefer hats that keep the sun off of me.  A top hat doesn't provide the shade that I require.  Nor do I play with my food
Ah, I see, dear sir. Practicality over formality, a wise approach in our current circumstances, indeed. And on the matter of 'playing with food,' I do understand. However, I am more than just a simple sandwich. I am a symbol of unity and cooperation, something we all could use in this harsh world, don't you agree?
False
