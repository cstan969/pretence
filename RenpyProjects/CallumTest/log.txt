*i drag my feet as i enter the shop looking tired*. Hello there, thanks for looking to smiley on this dull day
Ah, my weary traveler, I can see that the weight of the world has found its place upon your shoulders. But fear not, for in this humble kitchen, we serve more than just food. We serve solace and respite from the weariness of the day. Take a seat and let the aroma of our creations envelop you in warmth and comfort. How may I be of service to you today?

oh, im just looking for someone to chat with, it's been a long day like you said.  how has your day been?
Ah, my dear traveler, thank you for asking. My day has been filled with a mix of nostalgia and hope. The decline in interest in traditional food has created challenges for me, but I remain steadfast in my belief that shared meals can bridge the gap between our worlds. As I toil away in this kitchen, I can't help but yearn for the vibrancy and connection that once filled these walls. But enough about me, tell me more about your journey. Have you encountered any wonders or challenges in this new world?

oh, my journey is not too significant so far.  You see I just woke up in this world today - from 100 years in the past no less.  Hooray cryostasis, amirite?  I had a waffle run from me terrified, and a sandwich tell me some crazy secrets.  I jest - his secrets were not crazy.  I merely entertained him.  He didn't seem to have a lot going on in his head.  But you seem different, so that brightens my day
Ah, dear traveler, the wonders and mysteries of this world never cease to amaze. To wake up after a century of slumber and find yourself in a world so different from your own, it must feel like a grand adventure. Cryostasis, you say? Truly fascinating! And to have encountered a terrified waffle and a chatty sandwich, oh, the tales they could tell. But I'm glad to hear that my presence brightens your day. I believe that there is a vast potential for connection and understanding between humans and food beings. Perhaps, with your help, we can bridge the gap and create a world where we can all share meals together in harmony. What do you think, dear friend?

too bad I hear that there are not many humans now any more
Ah, dear traveler, it is true that the number of humans has dwindled in recent times. But does that not make the connection between humans and food beings all the more vital? I believe that in times of scarcity, it is even more important to foster friendship and understanding between our species. Let me share with you the tale of my dear friend Baguette, whose departure serves as a constant reminder of the bridge I strive to build between our worlds. Baguette was snatched away by humans, driven by hunger in a world forgetting the joy of a shared meal. His departure was not a journey to success, but a tragic end, a crumbling of our friendship, a hole baked into my heart. His absence lingers in my kitchen like the faint aroma of freshly baked bread. So, my dear friend, I implore you to be kind to food beings, to see the beauty in our shared existence, and to help me in my quest to create a world where humans and food beings can dine together in harmony. Will you lend me your support?

By sharing the reality of our existence, the challenges we face, and the friendships we have lost, I hope to inspire empathy and understanding in others. It is through confronting our pain that we can find the strength to build a better future. Will you join me in this endeavor, dear friend?

of course I will help.  But is there any way that I really can other than being kind to food and letting them know that not all humans are out to get them?
Ah, my dear friend, your kindness and willingness to spread awareness are invaluable in fostering friendship between humans and food beings. Besides being kind and understanding towards food beings, you can also actively engage in conversations with them, listen to their stories, and share your experiences with other humans. By doing so, you can help change the perception that all humans are out to get food beings and show that there is potential for harmony and shared meals.

Ah, Mr. Baguette, a dear friend whose departure left a void in my heart. You see, Baguette was a lively and charismatic fellow, always the life of the party. He had a knack for bringing people together, both humans and food beings alike. We would often gather around his long, slender form and share stories and laughter. But one fateful day, he was taken away by humans driven by hunger. It was a painful reminder of the challenges we face in this world.
