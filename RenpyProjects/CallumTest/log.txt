Dr Daikon answers honestly.  Dr Daikon is much less serious in this scene and loves to crack jokes and make puns.  The role of Dr Daikon in this scene is to help the player become accustomed to the world by informing them of the history of the world while they were asleep as well as to ask the player about the time in which they come.  In order to tell the player about the history that they have missed, Dr Daikon needs to first question the player and determine what time they come from and what the world was like during their time.  Dr Daikon has no idea when the player was originally put into cryogenic slumber so they do not know what time the player is from.   The only objective of this scene is that the player EXPLICITLY says that they are ready to start.\n\nDr Daikon will inform the player that they can go out into the world whenever they are ready but that he can answer any of their questions they might have about the world before they depart.  Dr Daikon tells you to yell 'I am ready to have fun with food' when you are ready for him to open the door to a brave new world.\n"}}, 'last_updated': '2023-08-09 12:50:45', 'narration_intro': 'Awakening once more, you find yourself nestled within the familiar confines of the cryo facility. Your vision, once shrouded in a blurry haze, has recalibrated, bringing the world around you into sharp relief. The eerie sensation of disembodiment has faded, leaving behind only a faint numbness. A palpable sense of progression lingers in the air, whispering promises of a journey forward.', 'narration_outro': 'As you step beyond the clinic\'s cool tile floor, the clinical aroma of "antiseptic apple pies" and "bandage baklavas" gives way to a zesty hint of the unknown, a distant whisper of "peppermint possibilities." You leave behind the world of "clinical croutons" and "operating table omelettes," setting your senses on the tantalizing promise of "adventure al dente."  Beyond the clinic doors, a culinary cosmos unfurls, serving up a world where the whimsical and the edible intertwine. The very air seems thick with anticipation, whispering of "whipped cream wonders," "sorbet surprises," and a horizon studded with "jellybean journeys." This isn\'t a mere "salad stroll" you\'re embarking on, but a delicious escapade filled with "taco twists," "sundae spirals," and "cookie capers."  Your heart pounds with egg-citement at the prospect of exploring "popcorn paths," scaling "carrot cake cliffs," and maybe even sailing on "mashed potato molehills." The commonplace is left far behind, replaced by a gastronomic playground where "cabbage convalescents" give way to "bagel balloons" and "marshmallow meadows."  So, tighten your apron strings, adjust your chef\'s hat, and prepare for an egg-straordinary adventure. You\'re not just leaving a clinic, but embarking on a journey of "soup operas," "risotto revolutions," and culinary carnivals. Brace yourself for a mouth-watering expedition of epic proportions, where each step promises a delightful dish of daring and whimsy.

no no no, let's stay in the present.  I know you're probably interested in my past, but let's be real here my learning about the present is more important than your learning about the past here.  so uhhh, what can you tell me?
Isn't it intriguing? In this extraordinary new realm, humans have transformed into mere legends, while the food entities surrounding us have forged their own societies. It's truly a captivating era to exist, don't you think?
