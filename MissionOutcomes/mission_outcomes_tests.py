Andre's armor, while of modest make, is polished to a shine and he often parades in it as if it's the armor of a legendary hero. He carries a standard sword he named 'Dragon's Bane,' though it has yet to see any real combat. Andre loves to spin tales of his 'adventures' â€” slaying mythical beasts, rescuing damsels from impossible perils, and single-handedly defeating bandit camps. He has an uncanny ability to make even the most mundane event sound like an epic quest, often at the expense of the truth. Despite his tall tales, Andre's actual combat skills are rudimentary at best. Those who've adventured with him often roll their eyes at his grandiose claims, but some can't help but admire his unshakeable confidence and wonder if one day, with enough real experience, his tales might just come true."
